    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name], a passionate and detail-driven engineer with a strong foundation in hands-on maintenance and a growing expertise in project planning and execution. With a background that includes both trade qualifications and engineering education, I bridge the gap between theory and practical application.</p>

    <p>Currently, I work as an Engineering Technical Officer at Sea World, where I’ve led and supported multiple maintenance and improvement projects across complex ride and facility systems. I started my career as a fitter & turner and have always been driven to understand how things work and how to make them better.</p>

    <p>My goal is to progress into roles that combine engineering knowledge with leadership and planning responsibilities — such as Maintenance Planner or Project Engineer — and contribute to impactful projects that prioritize safety, efficiency, and sustainability.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy learning new technologies, exploring nature, and continuously improving my technical and leadership skills.</p>
